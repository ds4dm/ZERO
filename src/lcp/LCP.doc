 Consider the Following linear complementarity problem with constraints
 @f{eqnarray}{
 Ax + By \leq b\\
 0 \leq x \perp Mx + Ny + q \geq 0
 @f}
 These are the types of problems that are handled by the class Game::LCP but
 we use a different notation. Instead of using @p y to refer to the variables
 that don't have matching complementary equations, we call <i>all</i> the
 variables as @p x and we keep track of the position of variables which are not
 complementary to any equation.

 <b>Points to note: </b>
 - The set of indices of @p x which are not complementary to any equation
 should be a consecutive set of indices. For consiceness, these components will
 be called as <i>Leader vars components</i> of @p x.
 - Suppose the leader vars components of @p x are removed from @p x, in the
 remaining components, the first component should be complementary to the first
 row defined by @p M, second component should be complementary to the second row
 defined by @p M and so on.

 Now consider the following linear complementarity problem.
 @f{align*}{
        x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \le 12\\
        0\le x_1 \perp x_4 - 1 \ge 0\\
        0\le x_2 \le 2 \\
        0 \le x_3 \perp 2x_3 + x_5 \ge 0\\
        0 \le x_4 \perp -x_1 + x_2 + 10 \ge 0\\
        0 \le x_5 \perp x_2 - x_3 + 5 \ge 0
 @f}
 Here indeed @f$ x_2 @f$ is the leader vars component with no complementarity
 equation. This problem can be entered into the Game::LCP class as follows.
 @code
        arma::sp_mat M(4, 5); // We have four complementarity eqns and 5
 variables. arma::vec q(4); M.zeros();
        // First eqn
        M(0, 3) = 1;
        q(0) = -1;
        // Second eqn
        M(1, 2) = 2;
        M(1, 4)  = 1;
        q(1) = 0;
        // Third eqn
        M(2, 0) = -1;
        M(2, 1) = 1;
        q(2) = 10;
        // Fourth eqn
        M(3, 1) = 1 ;
        M(3, 2) = -1;
        q(3) = 5;
        // Other common constraints
        arma::sp_mat A(2, 5); arma::vec b;
        A.zeros();
        // x_2 <= 2 constraint
        A(0, 1) = 1;
        b(0) = 2;
        // x_1 + x_2 + x_3 <= 12 constraint
        A(1, 0) = 1;
        A(1, 1) = 1;
        A(1, 2) = 1;
        b(1) = 12;
 @endcode

 Now, since the variable with no complementarity pair is @f$x_2@f$ which is in
 position @p 1 (counting from 0) of the vector @p x, the arguments @p LeadStart
 and @p LeadEnd in the constructor, Game::LCP::LCP are @p 1 as below.
 @code
                GRBEnv env;
                LCP lcp = LCP(&env, M, q, 1, 1, A, b);
 @endcode
 This problem can be solved either using big-M based disjunctive formulation
 with the value of the @p bigM can also be chosen. But a more preferred means of
 solving is by using indicator constraints, where the algorithm tries to
 automatically identify good choices of @p bigM for each disjunction. Use the
 former option, only if you are very confident of  your choice of a small value
 of @p bigM.
 @code
 // Solve using bigM constraints
 lcp.useIndicators = false;
 lcp.bigM = 1e5;
 auto bigMModel = lcp.LCPasMIP(true);

 // Solve using indicator constraints
 lcp.useIndicators = true;
 auto indModel = lcp.LCPasMIP(true);
 @endcode
 Both @p bigMModel and @p indModel are std::unique_ptr  to GRBModel objects.
 So all native gurobi operations can be performed on these objects.

 This LCP as multiple solutions. In fact the solution set can be parameterized
 as below.
 @f{align}{
 x_1 &= 10 + t\\
 x_2 &= t\\
 x_3 &= 0\\
 x_4 &= 1\\
 x_5 &= 0
 @f}
 for @f$t \in [0, 1]@f$.

 But some times, one might want to solve an MPEC. i.e., optimize over the
 feasible region of the set as decribed above. For this purpose, two functions
 Game::LCP::MPECasMILP and Game::LCP::MPECasMIQP are available, depending upon
 whether one wants to optimize a linear objective function or a convex quadratic
 objective function over the set of solutions.
