Welcome
=====================================

ZERO is a modular C++ library interfacing Mathematical Programming and Game Theory.
It provides a comprehensive toolkit of modeling interfaces, helper tools, and algorithms to design games and find their Nash equilibria.
In particular, the software supports Reciprocally Bilinear Games (RBGs), simultaneous non-cooperative games where each player solves a mathematical program with a linear objective in the player's variable and bilinear in its opponents' variables.
This class elementary generalizes to a multi-agent setting the tasks of classical Operations Research problems. ZERO also supports integer non-convexities, linear bilevel problems, and linear equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints.
